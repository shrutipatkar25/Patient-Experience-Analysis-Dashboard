# Patient-Experience-Analysis-Dashboard

In this Project I have used a healthcare dataset of patient experience, the link to the dataset is here:

https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/8c70-d353

The dataset talks about patient experience rating based on specified parameters for each healthcare provider. To summarize the entire dataset 
in a single report I have created a dashboard which provides Average Patient Experience rating along with the specified parameters for all the providers.

Steps I followed:
1. Import and Understand the dataset in Power Query
2. Data Cleaning and Data Modelling
3. Data Visualization
